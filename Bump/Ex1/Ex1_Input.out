DDS neighborhood size parameter:  0.200000 
Number of optimization trials with above parameters:     20   
Number of total objective function evaluations per trial:  10000   

Program randomly generated initial solutions.
Matlab version 5 and higher random number generator used for this run.
   User entered random state 1 as:  123456789
   User entered random state 2 as:  987654321
For each trial,    50 random initial solutions are evaluated & best is initial DDS solution.
To replicate these results use random initial solution and the same 2 random states.
Use initial solution file Ex1_ini.out and vary random states for more optimization trials 
to start at the initial solutions for this run.

More OUTPUT files written by program are as follows:
    Ex1_ini.out contains initial solutions used in all trials.
        - Row 1 is trial 1, Row 2 is trial 2, etc.  Dec Vars 1 thru D in columns 1 thru D.
    20 files named Ex1_#.out store Jbest, Jtest and Dec Vars by iter# for each trial.
    20 files named Ex1_sbest#.out store best decision variable (Dec Var) values (i.e. solutions) for each trial.
        - Row 1 is trial 1, Row 2 is trial 2, etc.  Variables 1 thru D in columns 1 thru D.
    Ex1_AVG.out contains averaged output data across trials - Jbest and Jtest.
    Ex1_sbest.out contains the best decision variable values found for all trials.
        - Row 1 is trial 1, Row 2 is trial 2, etc.  Dec Vars 1 thru D in columns 1 thru D.
    Ex1_trials.out contains Jbest for all iterations across all trials.
        - Column 1 is Jbest from trial 1, Col 2 from trial 2 etc...

 Note that Jbest -> is the best value of the objective function found so far and 
          Jtest -> is the objective function value of the test, or candidate solution.
