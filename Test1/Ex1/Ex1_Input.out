This file lists all inputs for the Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) Algorithm (ver 1.1) by Bryan Tolson.

DDS algorithm used to MINIMIZE the ackley10.m function or program. 
Date of optimization run: 20-Oct-2011 17:28:23 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

User has no additional comments on run.

Decision variables are:

Name       MIN       MAX 
1      -2.0000     2.0000 
2      -2.0000     2.0000 
3      -2.0000     2.0000 
4      -2.0000     2.0000 
5      -2.0000     2.0000 
6      -2.0000     2.0000 
7      -2.0000     2.0000 
8      -2.0000     2.0000 
9      -2.0000     2.0000 
10     -2.0000     2.0000 

DDS neighborhood size parameter:  0.200000 
Number of optimization trials with above parameters:      2   
Number of total objective function evaluations per trial:   1000   

Program randomly generated initial solutions.
Matlab version 5 and higher random number generator used for this run.
   User entered random state 1 as:  123456789
   User entered random state 2 as:  987654321
For each trial,     5 random initial solutions are evaluated & best is initial DDS solution.
To replicate these results use random initial solution and the same 2 random states.
Use initial solution file Ex1_ini.out and vary random states for more optimization trials 
to start at the initial solutions for this run.

More OUTPUT files written by program are as follows:
    Ex1_ini.out contains initial solutions used in all trials.
        - Row 1 is trial 1, Row 2 is trial 2, etc.  Dec Vars 1 thru D in columns 1 thru D.
    2 files named Ex1_#.out store Jbest, Jtest and Dec Vars by iter# for each trial.
    2 files named Ex1_sbest#.out store best decision variable (Dec Var) values (i.e. solutions) for each trial.
        - Row 1 is trial 1, Row 2 is trial 2, etc.  Variables 1 thru D in columns 1 thru D.
    Ex1_AVG.out contains averaged output data across trials - Jbest and Jtest.
    Ex1_sbest.out contains the best decision variable values found for all trials.
        - Row 1 is trial 1, Row 2 is trial 2, etc.  Dec Vars 1 thru D in columns 1 thru D.
    Ex1_trials.out contains Jbest for all iterations across all trials.
        - Column 1 is Jbest from trial 1, Col 2 from trial 2 etc...

 Note that Jbest -> is the best value of the objective function found so far and 
          Jtest -> is the objective function value of the test, or candidate solution.
